# xcstrings translator

xcstrings translator is a simple tool to translate `.xcstrings` files, using Apple's Translate framework.
The tool is written in Swift and uses the Apple's Translate framework to translate the `.xcstrings` files.

Please note that this tool is still in development and may not work as expected.

## Limitations/TODO

- It cannot save the translated `.xcstrings` files.
- The translations are not saved in the (internal) array, which would be saved later as a `.xcstrings` file.
- Translate in _all_ supported languages with one button.
- Skip string if it's already translated.
- Skip strings marked with `shouldTranslate: false`.
- Improve code quality, ui fixes.
- ... probably more.

## Finished
- Input language detection.
- Translate to a specific language.

## Alternatives

I'm not planning to add support for `Google Translate`, `DeepL`, `Microsoft Translator` or any other (AI) translation service, If you think it should be added, feel welcome to create a pull request.

Alternatives to this tool are (but not limited to):
- [TranslateKit](https://translatekit.app) by [Cihat G√ºnd√ºz](https://www.fline.dev/about/?ref=wesleydegroot.nl), TranslateKit uses `DeepL`, `Google Translate` and `Microsoft Translator`, it relies on in-app subscriptions.
